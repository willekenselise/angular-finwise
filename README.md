2. Obtain your Firebase project credentials, including the API key, project ID, and other necessary information
3. Active FireAuth and FireStorage for authentification and storage
4. Create a new file named `environment.ts`and `environment.development.ts` in the `src/environments` directory.
5. Open the `environment.ts` and `environment.development.ts` files and add the following code:

```
export const environment = {
    production: false,

    }

```
6. Save the file and run your Angular app
